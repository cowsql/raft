 * such an application receives a new message over the wire, the raft_io
 * implementation will err out or drop the message, because it doesn't know how
 * to decode it based on its type.
 * raft_io implementations compiled against versions of raft that know the new
 * message type but at runtime are linked against an older raft lib, will pass
 * the message to raft, where raft will drop it.
 * When raft receives a message and accesses a field of a new message type,
 * the raft_io implementation must have known about the new message type,
 * so it was compiled against a modern enough version of raft, and memory
 * accesses should be safe.

 * Sending a new message type with a raft_io implementation that doesn't know

     * 2. #configuration_committed_index is non-zero and
     *    #configuration_uncommitted_index is zero. This means that
     *    #configuration is committed and there is no pending configuration
     *    change. The content of #configuration must match the one of the log
     *    entry at #configuration_committed_index.
     *
     * 3. #configuration_committed_index and #configuration_uncommitted_index
     *    are both non-zero, with the latter being greater than the former. This
     *    means that #configuration is uncommitted and represents a pending
     *    configuration change. The content of #configuration must match the one
     *    of the log entry at #configuration_uncommitted_index.
     *
     * When a new configuration is committed, a copy of it is saved in
     * #configuration_committed, so it can be easily retrieved in case the
     * log gets truncated because of compaction and does not contain the entry
     * at #configuration_committed_index anymore. Likewise, if a snapshot is
